# Good Vibe Driving
There are two main types of driving lessons available: private lessons and group lessons. Private lessons are one-on-one with an instructor, while group lessons are typically with 3-5 students and an instructor. Both types of lessons have their own advantages and disadvantages.
Private lessons are more expensive than group lessons, but they offer more personalized instruction. The instructor can focus on your individual needs and weaknesses, and you can get more practice driving. Group lessons are less expensive, but you may not get as much individual [동탄운전연수](https://www.goodvibedriving.com/). However, you may learn from watching and interacting with other students. Your first driving lesson will likely focus on the basics, such as how to start, stop, and steer the car. You may also learn about basic traffic laws and safety procedures. Your instructor will assess your skills and experience to determine what you need to learn next. The best way to prepare for your driving test is to practice regularly. Try to drive in a variety of conditions, such as city traffic, highways, and rural roads. You should also review the driver's handbook and take practice tests to familiarize yourself with the types of questions that will be on the test.
